# Recipes and Rating üçΩÔ∏è

## Investigation Question: What types of recipes tend to have the most calories?

### INTRODUCTION
### This study is helpful for people who may be trying to watch their calorie intakes while still being able to enjoy various types of delicious recipes. There are two initial datasets that this study will be using one containing information about the recipes, and the other containing reviews of recipes in the first dataset - it will be combined to form one big dataset keeping all the recipes with reviews.


### Dataset
The two following datasets are available for this investigation: 

1. `RAW_recipes.csv` a DataFrame that consists of information regarding food recipes with 11 columns, indexed by recipe names:

   - `id`: a series of numbers serving as identification that differentiates each recipe
   - `minutes`: the number of minutes the recipe takes to finish 
   - `contributor_id`: a unique combination of numbers that differentiates each contributor
   - `submitted`: the data of submission formatted as MM/DD/YYYY
   - `tags`: a list of tags that can be used to categorize each recipe
   - `nutrition`: a list of floats entrailing nutritional values
   - `n_steps`: the number of steps in the recipe
   - `steps`: a list of steps to follow for the recipe
   - `description`: describes what the recipe makes 
   - `ingredients`: a list of items used to create the final product
   - `n_ingredients`: the number of ingredients needed for the recipe

2. `interactions.csv`: a DataFrame that consists of information regarding people's reviews of certain recipes with 4 columns, indexed by user_id:

   - `recipe_id`: a series of numbers serving as identification that differentiates each recipe
   - `date`: the data of the review being sent formatted as MM/DD/YYYY
   - `rating`: a rating out of 5 for the recipe
   - `review`: comments made by the reviewer about the recipe

### DATA CLEANING AND EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
### Steps Taken To Clean The Data 
There are four segments or rather four steps consisting of several lines of code for each step.
1. Merging and Using Data Frames 
   
   I've merged `RAW_recipes.csv` and `interaction.csv` using the recipe names and preserving all rows (recipes) from the first data frame. I then used the merged dataset to calculate for 'avg_rating_per_recipe', which serves as a new column for the recipe data frame for usage in the rest of the analysis.

2. Converting Strings

   The `RAW_recipes.csv` is needed for several columns to be converted from strings. The 'submitted' column was converted to date-times, and the columns' nutrition, tags, steps, and ingredients were all converted into functioning lists.

3. Minimizing the Data Frame

   To prevent any outlandish statistics, I've decided to filter the recipe data frame to only include recipes with less than 3,000 calories to adhere to realistic 1-serving sizes. Since some of the recipes have calories to the hundreds of thousands, there could be user error when inputting values and/or too big of serving sizes. The primary goal is to prevent extreme data from heavily skewing the analysis results.

This is how the resulting data frame that will be used for analysis will look like!

### ASSESSMENT OF MISSINGNESS
### Not Missing At Random (NMAR) Analysis

There are three columns in the `recipe` data frame, `'name'`, `'description'`, and `'avg_rating'`, which could all possibly be Not Missing At Random (NMAR), assuming the following conditions:
- `'name'`: Users may choose not to provide a name if the recipe is simple or something very common. In this case, the missingness depends on the type of name the recipe would have had. 
- `'description'`: Similarly to the recipe names, users may choose not to describe if the recipe doesn't need any description due to its simplicity or self-explanatory. This makes the missingness depend on what would submitted to describe the recipe.
- `'avg_rating'`: People may have not rated the recipes, possibly due to not having tried them or having a negative experience. This makes the missingness tied to the user's unobserved actions, resulting in NMAR.

All three conditions rely on the idea that unobserved values explain why the data is missing, which is characteristic of NMAR.

### Missingness Dependency

I used permutation testing to evaluate whether the two columns, 'avg rating' and 'calories', are dependent on each other. Through the permutation testing, a p-value of 0.000999000999000999 was evaluated concluding that under a significance level of 0.05 the missingness of 'avg rating' is dependent on the 'calorie' column. This is further elaborated through the graph showing that as calories increase there are a lot more average rating values missing.

### HYPOTHESIS TESTING

### Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis: The mean calories for low-rated recipes is greater than or equal to the mean calories for high-rated recipes.

Alternative Hypothesis: The mean calories for low-rated recipes is less than that of high-rated recipes.

### Test Method
A permutation test was conducted with the following steps:
- Recipes are split into 2 groups based on ratings: low-rated: < 3, high-rated: => 3
- Test Statistic: mean of low-rated - mean of high-rated
- Shuffling 1000 times
- Significance Level: 0.05

### Test Result
Observed Mean Difference: 0.7628970266521833
p_value: 0.538
Reject or Fail to Reject: Fail to reject the null hypothesis

Since the p_value > significance level, there is no statistical significance to suggest that low-rated recipes have fewer calories than high-rated recipes. Any difference in calories happened by chance and is unlikely to reflect accurate real events. 

The test statistic for this test is the mean difference between the mean calories for low-rated recipes and the mean calories for high-rated recipes and a significance level of 0.05.

This test is appropriate because it allows me to compare the mean calories of two different groups without assuming any specific distribution of the data. It addresses whether the observed difference is statistically unusual, helping with my investigation about which types of recipes tend to have more calories. This shows the relationship between the two groups and possibly providing a partial solution to my investigative question!
